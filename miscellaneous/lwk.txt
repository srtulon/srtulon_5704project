There is no dening architecture of a \typical" LWK. The
ones in existences dier signicantly from each other, and
several other types of OS kernels are also lightweight: nano,
exo, micro, and embedded kernels come to mind. What
we mean by an LWK is a kernel specically designed and
streamlined for the very high end of HPC; computers that
deserve the name supercomputer, and a subset of applica-
tions and data sets that require machines like that. These
systems have extreme scales and levels of parallelism.
In [23] we nd this description:
\. . . lightweight kernels (LWK), which focus
on providing exactly and only those services needed
by specic hardware and a small set of mission-
critical applications."
