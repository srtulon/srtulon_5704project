definition of lwk in kind of vague. FWK was invention with compatibility in mind and lwk was invented with scalibilty in mind


In particular, the factoring of the OS node into separate CPU
driver and monitor components is not required by the model; our
experience is that it is not optimal for performance, but has compelling
engineering advantages. The downside of the separation
is that invocations from processes to the OS are now mostly local
RPC calls (and hence two context switches) rather than system
calls, adding a constant overhead on current hardware of several
thousand cycles. However, this is constant as the number of cores
increases. Moving the monitor into kernel space would remove this
penalty, at the cost of a more complex kernel-mode code base.
